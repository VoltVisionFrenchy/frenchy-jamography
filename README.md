# frenchy-jamography
a collection of jams, this time filtered for frenchy, next time filtered for you


## ToDo:
- For the Video Metadata, put rating at top, ID @ bottom, change date to performance date
- Allow editing metadata easily?
- Combine Venue, City, State into one line?
- Allow audio only?  (SoundCloud? Archive.org)?
- Invite other people's comments?
- Lots of metadata is wrong, should parse each video id and fix/update
- Make sure all items from original Jamography note in Evernote are present
- also how to handle any missing playlists from youtube
- Comments that appear @ specific timestamps?
